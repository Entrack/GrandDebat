This notebook is the result of some research conducted on how to preprocess data, form new labels and apply NLP models in the task of zipCode prediction on the GrandDÃ©bat dataset  
This notebook contains some instruments and parameters (like, for example, SVD compression degree) for you to be able to further get better results  
Ready-to-go results of the label extraction and NLP models application can be downloaded from the /output folder
